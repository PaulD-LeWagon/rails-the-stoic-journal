It wasn't a bad job but its not what I wanted to do. I, obviously, want to get into Web Development or similar role. I have been in to coding, on and off, for quite a few years now. However, I didn't go to Uni nor do I have any industry recognised certification which meant I couldn't get passed the 'Recruitment Agencies'! So, I'm hoping this bootcamp can remedy that although, If I succeed on this bootcamp the freelance route could be a better option. I was a little apprehensive about applying for this course, initially, as I've practically no experience with the Ruby Programming language but quickly realised it would be a worth while challenge and learning experience."]]

It wasn't a bad job but its not what I wanted to do. I, obviously, want to get into Web Development or similar role. I have been in to coding, on and off, for quite a few years now. However, I didn't go to Uni nor do I have any industry recognised certification which meant I couldn't get passed the 'Recruitment Agencies'! So, I'm hoping this bootcamp can remedy that although, If I succeed on this bootcamp the freelance route could be a better option. I was a little apprehensive about applying for this course, initially, as I've practically no experience with the Ruby Programming language but quickly realised it would be a worth while challenge and learning experience."]]

It wasn't a bad job but its not what I wanted to do. I, obviously, want to get into Web Development or similar role. I have been in to coding, on and off, for quite a few years now. However, I didn't go to Uni nor do I have any industry recognised certification which meant I couldn't get passed the 'Recruitment Agencies'! So, I'm hoping this bootcamp can remedy that although, If I succeed on this bootcamp the freelance route could be a better option. I was a little apprehensive about applying for this course, initially, as I've practically no experience with the Ruby Programming language but quickly realised it would be a worth while challenge and learning experience."]]

It wasn't a bad job but its not what I wanted to do. I, obviously, want to get into Web Development or similar role. I have been in to coding, on and off, for quite a few years now. However, I didn't go to Uni nor do I have any industry recognised certification which meant I couldn't get passed the 'Recruitment Agencies'! So, I'm hoping this bootcamp can remedy that although, If I succeed on this bootcamp the freelance route could be a better option. I was a little apprehensive about applying for this course, initially, as I've practically no experience with the Ruby Programming language but quickly realised it would be a worth while challenge and learning experience."]]
